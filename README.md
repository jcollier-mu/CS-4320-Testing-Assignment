# CS-4320-Testing-Assignment
Submission for testing assignment using pytest

These tests can be run simply by typing 'pytest' into the terminal. All of the tests are contained in grading_system_test.py. Of the pytest output, 5 tests pass and 10 fail. The assigned tests are the first 10 in the file and the 5 I designed are the last 5 tests in the file.
